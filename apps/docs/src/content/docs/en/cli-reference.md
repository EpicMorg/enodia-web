description: Every enodia command, straight from --help.
---

Every command also accepts `-h`/`--help`. This page is generated from
the same output, kept in sync by hand against the actual built binary
rather than written from memory.

## Global flags

Available on every command:

```
--config string     path to enodia.yaml (default: search standard locations)
--settings string   path to settings.yaml (default: search standard locations; missing is not an error)
```

## `enodia collect`

```
collect only gathers facts: an unreachable target is recorded as an
observation with an error, not treated as a command failure. The exit
code reflects whether collection itself ran, not what it found - that
judgement is check's job.
```

```
-o, --output string   output file, or - for stdout (default "-")
```

## `enodia check`

```
check evaluates the patch, lifecycle and newer-branch axes for every
target as of the moment its data was collected. Without --from it
collects first, in this same process - not a second code path. With
--from it reads an existing inventory and only ever reaches the network
for the lifecycle resolver.

--view selects the table focus: compact (default), lifecycle, drift, or
fleet - the offline-only view of version spread across a product's
instances. When --view is not passed, settings.yaml's render.default_view
applies instead of the compact default, if set.
```

```
--fail-on strings   escalate an axis value to a hard failure, e.g. --fail-on=patch:behind (repeatable)
--from string       read an existing inventory instead of collecting
--view string       table view: compact, lifecycle, drift, or fleet (default "compact")
--warn-days int      warn this many days before a lifecycle boundary is reached
```

## `enodia export`

```
export writes one self-contained file - nothing here serves it; nginx,
a cron job, or a systemd timer regenerating it is what does.

--format selects json, prometheus, or html.

--view restricts an html export to one view (compact, lifecycle, drift,
or fleet) instead of all four stacked sections; ignored by
json/prometheus, which always carry every observation and assessment.
```

```
--fail-on strings   escalate an axis value to a hard failure (repeatable)
--format string     output format: json, prometheus, or html (default "json")
--from string       read an existing inventory instead of collecting
-o, --output string  output file, or - for stdout (default "-")
--view string        html only: restrict the report to one view (compact, lifecycle, drift, fleet); default is all four
--warn-days int       warn this many days before a lifecycle boundary is reached
```

## `enodia config`

Three subcommands, no flags of its own beyond the global ones.

### `enodia config path`

Prints which config file would actually be used, given the current
search order — see [Configuration](/en/configuration/#file-locations).

### `enodia config resolve`

```
resolve tries https, then http (never http first - that would put a
credential on the wire in the clear), for every target whose address
has no explicit scheme. It sends no credentials and does not modify the
config file - it only reports what scheme each target would use.
```

### `enodia config validate`

Validates the config file and its credential references — including
whether a target's declared `credentials:` name actually resolves to an
entry the probe understands, entirely offline.

## `enodia products`

Lists every supported product — see [Supported products](/en/products/)
for the full table.

## `enodia history`

```
history reads every "*.jsonl" file in --dir and evaluates each one
against its own collection time - not today - building one timeline
per target ID. Producing that directory needs no code at all, just
"enodia collect -o \"$(date +%F).jsonl\"" on a schedule. This command is
the other half: reading many of them back as one history.
```

```
--dir string         directory of dated *.jsonl inventories (required)
--fail-on strings    escalate an axis value to a hard failure (repeatable)
--format string      output format: table or json (default "table")
-o, --output string   output file, or - for stdout (default "-")
--warn-days int        warn this many days before a lifecycle boundary is reached
```

## `enodia serve`

```
serve collects and evaluates on a timer (--interval) and serves
whatever the last successful cycle produced - a request never triggers
a new collection. There is no built-in authentication or TLS: put this
behind a reverse proxy.

Endpoints: / (HTML, all four views), /report.json, /metrics
(Prometheus), /healthz (liveness only - never touches the snapshot).
```

```
--fail-on strings     escalate an axis value to a hard failure (repeatable) - reflected in the served report, not a process exit code
--interval duration    how often to refresh the snapshot (default 1h0m0s)
--listen string         address to listen on (default ":8080")
--warn-days int          warn this many days before a lifecycle boundary is reached
```

## `enodia version`

Prints the enodia version, commit, and build date.

## `enodia about`

Prints the enodia logo plus build information: version, commit, build
date, Go version, platform, product (probe) count, license, and
repository URL.

## `enodia completion`

Generates a shell autocompletion script. Run
`enodia completion --help` for the specific shell you use (bash, zsh,
fish, powershell).
