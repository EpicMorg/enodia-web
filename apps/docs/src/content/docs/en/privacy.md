description: What enodia connects to and what it stores — no telemetry.
---

enodia is a command-line tool you run on your own machine. It has no
telemetry, no usage statistics, no update check and no account. EpicMorg
runs no server that enodia talks to and receives nothing from it.

This page mirrors enodia's own
[`PRIVACY.md`](https://github.com/EpicMorg/enodia/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).

## What enodia connects to

- **Your own services** — the targets listed in your `enodia.yaml`, over
  HTTPS, SSH or their native protocols, with the credentials you
  configure, to read their version (and, for Linux hosts, the installed
  package list).
- **endoflife.date** (`https://endoflife.date/api/...`) — to fetch public
  release and end-of-life dates. The request names a product (for
  example `postgresql`); no host names, addresses, versions or other
  data about your fleet are sent.
- **GitHub API** (`https://api.github.com/repos/.../releases`,
  `.../tags`) — for products whose releases are published on GitHub.
  Same as above: only the public repository name is in the request. If
  you set `GITHUB_TOKEN`, it is sent to GitHub only, to raise the rate
  limit.
- **CVE database publishers**, only when you run `enodia cve update`,
  and only those your `cve.*.path` entries name: nvd.nist.gov,
  bdu.fstec.ru, security-tracker.debian.org, the OVAL publishers
  (Canonical, Red Hat, AlmaLinux, Oracle, Astra Linux, RED OS),
  secdb.alpinelinux.org, mariadb.com, api.atlassian.com,
  www.postgresql.org and nginx.org. The requests are plain downloads of
  public files; the only thing they say about your fleet is which OS
  releases and PostgreSQL majors you fetch data for.

That is all. Every other command only reads the CVE files from disk —
see [CVE correlation](/en/cve/).

The HTML report loads Bootstrap from a CDN (jsDelivr / cdnjs) **in the
browser that opens it** when `html.assets: cdn` is set; the default
(`inline`) makes no external requests at all — see
[Reporting](/en/reporting/).

## What enodia stores

Only on your machine, and only where you tell it to:

- the inventory, reports and history files you write with `-o`;
- a cache of endoflife.date/GitHub answers and parsed CVE databases in
  the OS cache directory (`~/.cache/enodia`, `%LocalAppData%\enodia`) —
  safe to delete at any time.

Nothing is sent anywhere else, and nothing is retained by EpicMorg.

The enodia.sh, get.enodia.sh and docs.enodia.sh websites — not the enodia
tool — use Yandex.Metrica web analytics to count visits.
